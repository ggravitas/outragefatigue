― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
“Choose someone whose way of life as well as words, and whose very face as mirroring the character that lies behind it, have won your approval. Be always pointing him out to yourself either as your guardian or as your model. This is a need, in my view, for someone as a standard against which our characters can measure themselves. Without a ruler to do it against you won’t make the crooked straight.” — Seneca, Letters From a Stoic
“Does what’s happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness, and all other qualities that allow a person’s nature to fulfill itself? So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.” — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
“Don’t just say you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person. Books are the training weights of the mind. They are very helpful, but it would be a bad mistake to suppose that one has made progress simply by having internalized their contents.” — Epictetus, The Art of Living
“‘A consciousness of wrongdoing is the first step to salvation.’ This remark of Epicurus’ is to me a very good one. For a person who is not aware that he is doing anything wrong has no desire to be put right. You have to catch yourself doing it before you can reform. Some people boast about their failings: can you imagine someone who counts his faults as merits ever giving thought to their cure? So—to the best of your ability—demonstrate your own guilt, conduct inquiries of your own into all the evidence against yourself. Play the first part of prosecutor, then of judge and finally of pleader in mitigation. Be harsh with yourself at times.” — Seneca, Letters From a Stoic</li>
</ul>
<p>“A key point to bear in mind: The value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object. You’re better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve.” — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
“Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.” — Seneca, Letters From a Stoic</p>
<h2>The Six Core Principles of Evolutionary Psychology</h2>
<p>The discipline of Evolutionary Psychology was founded on six core principles that combine a traditional understanding of psychology along with evolutionary biology ideas of how the brain functions. These principles are as follows:​​</p>
<ol>
<li>The human brain's purpose is to process information, and in doing so, it produces responses to both external and internal stimuli.</li>
<li>The human brain adapted and has undergone both natural and sexual selection.</li>
<li>The parts of the human brain are specialized to solve problems that occurred over evolutionary time.</li>
<li>Modern humans have brains that evolved after problems recurred time and time again over long periods of time.</li>
<li>Most of the human brain's functions are done unconsciously. Even problems that seem easy to solve take very intricate neural responses at an unconscious level.</li>
<li>Many very specialized mechanisms make up the whole of human psychology. All of these mechanisms together create human nature.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href=\"/tag:manifesto#body-wrapper\">Manifestos</a></h2>
<p>To me, a personal manifesto is like a grand unified theory of life, and I try to hold myself accountable to it, to various degrees of success. Most of us, I’d say, have actively, as well as unconsciously, sought to define ourselves; we try to figure out who we are and what we believe in. Some people find answers in religion, others in politics or philosophy, and most of us end up with a mishmash of all the above. This serves as our guiding principles on how we live and how we treat our neighbors. But after we crawl out of adolescence and get on with living, most of us – I think – put aside this quest to the point we don’t even realize how successful or unsuccessful we are at living up to our principles. Since I was young, this has fascinated me. And since through this blog I’m still trying to figuring people out, I thought I’d share some manifestos as a sort of menu. There’s something for all tastes.</p>
