<p>To me, a personal manifesto is like a grand unified theory of life, and I try to hold myself accountable to it, to various degrees of success. Most of us, I’d say, have actively, as well as unconsciously, sought to define ourselves; we try to figure out who we are and what we believe in. Some people find answers in religion, others in politics or philosophy, and most of us end up with a mishmash of all the above. This serves as our guiding principles on how we live and how we treat our neighbors. But after we crawl out of adolescence and get on with living, most of us – I think – put aside this quest to the point we don’t even realize how successful or unsuccessful we are at living up to our principles. Since I was young, this has fascinated me. And since through this blog I’m still trying to figuring people out, I thought I’d share some manifestos as a sort of menu. There’s something for all tastes.</p>
