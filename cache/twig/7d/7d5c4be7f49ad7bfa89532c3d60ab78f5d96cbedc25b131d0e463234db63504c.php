<h2>The Six Core Principles of Evolutionary Psychology</h2>
<p>The discipline of Evolutionary Psychology was founded on six core principles that combine a traditional understanding of psychology along with evolutionary biology ideas of how the brain functions. These principles are as follows:​​</p>
<ol>
<li>The human brain's purpose is to process information, and in doing so, it produces responses to both external and internal stimuli.</li>
<li>The human brain adapted and has undergone both natural and sexual selection.</li>
<li>The parts of the human brain are specialized to solve problems that occurred over evolutionary time.</li>
<li>Modern humans have brains that evolved after problems recurred time and time again over long periods of time.</li>
<li>Most of the human brain's functions are done unconsciously. Even problems that seem easy to solve take very intricate neural responses at an unconscious level.</li>
<li>Many very specialized mechanisms make up the whole of human psychology. All of these mechanisms together create human nature.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href=\"/tag:manifesto#body-wrapper\">Manifestos</a></h2>
<p>To me, a personal manifesto is like a grand unified theory of life, and I try to hold myself accountable to it, to various degrees of success. Most of us, I’d say, have actively, as well as unconsciously, sought to define ourselves; we try to figure out who we are and what we believe in. Some people find answers in religion, others in politics or philosophy, and most of us end up with a mishmash of all the above. This serves as our guiding principles on how we live and how we treat our neighbors. But after we crawl out of adolescence and get on with living, most of us – I think – put aside this quest to the point we don’t even realize how successful or unsuccessful we are at living up to our principles. Since I was young, this has fascinated me. And since through this blog I’m still trying to figuring people out, I thought I’d share some manifestos as a sort of menu. There’s something for all tastes.</p>
